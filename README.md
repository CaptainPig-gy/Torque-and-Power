### The purpose of this research was to determine the maximum power and torque achievable from a four-stroke, four-cylinder Honda Civic Engine. This program utilizes manufacturer data ranging from 1000 to 7000 rpm to visualize the relationship.

### After thorough research, it was discovered that the 1.8L 4-cylinder engine is capable of producing 174 Nm (128 lb-ft) of torque and 140 horsepower, consistent with the car's advertised specifications upon release.
